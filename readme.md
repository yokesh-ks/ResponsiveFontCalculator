This responsive font calculator is used to clamp a value between an upper and lower bound. This calculator gives an output of a minimum value, a responsive value, and a maximum allowed value.

The clamp() function takes three comma separated expressions as its parameter, in the order of minimum value, preferred value, maximum value.

In this tool, we utilised the clamp CSS function in our project. Clamp () allows you to choose a value in the centre of a range of values between a set minimum and maximum.
 
The smallest value is the minimum. This is the lowest limit of the allowable range of values. The minimum value will be used if the preferred value is less than this value.

As long as the result is between the minimum and maximum values, the preferred value is the expression whose value will be utilised.

If the preferred value is greater than this upper bound, the maximum value is the greatest (most positive) expression value to which the property's value will be set.
